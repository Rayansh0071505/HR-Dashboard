# HR-Dashboard

<b>The PowerBI dashboard designed for HR enables them to monitor the number of employees attending office, taking sick leaves, and working from home, and determine the percentage of each. The purpose is to understand the number of people who prefer to work from home and the days of the week when employees tend to take leave. By analyzing this data, HR can identify areas for improvement and plan events accordingly.
